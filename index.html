  <h2>About Me 🔍</h2>
    <p>
    Hi!!
    My name is Ana Lisboa. 
    
  I am a bioinformatics specialist with a strong passion for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity. I am proactive, adaptable, and curious, thriving in collaborative environments while also taking initiative to learn independently and tackle complex challenges. I enjoy analyzing data, finding creative solutions, and applying insights to make a meaningful impact.

I hold a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics, where I developed a solid foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and computational approaches for solving complex biological problems. Throughout my studies, I honed my technical skills and cultivated a mindset geared toward continuous learning, innovation, and problem-solving.

Professionally, I am gaining experience in Application Security Engineering (AppSec) and data-driven projects, where I analyze source code, identify and document vulnerabilities, support secure coding practices, and optimize processes for managing security-related data. I am comfortable working in diverse teams, adapting to new environments, and contributing effectively to achieve shared goals.

I am eager to continue growing professionally, expanding my expertise, and contributing to innovative projects at the intersection of technology, data, and security.

        <h3>Bachelor's degree in Biology</h3>
        <p>I attended the biology degree program for 3 years at the University of Minho. I learned about a wide range of subjects, from microorganisms to biophysics, statistics, and biochemistry. It was there that I had my first contact with bioinformatics. I participated in several projects, including one at the Center for Biological Engineering and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory.</p>

        <h3>Master's degree in Bioinformaticss</h3>
        <p>While still at the University of Minho, I began my journey in computer science by enrolling in a master's program in bioinformatics. There, I was introduced to my first programming languages, Python and R. I took courses in bioinformatics algorithms, machine learning, and databases. At the end of 2024, I defended my thesis, which was titled "Application of Machine Learning Methodologies in the Search for New Peptides with Antimicrobial Potential."</p>

    <h3>💊Application of Machine Learning Methodologies in the Search for New Peptides with Antimicrobial Potential</h3>
    <p>Master’s Dissertation: Investigated the application of Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures for the screening and repurposing of antimicrobial compounds. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation on large biomedical datasets, aiming to identify promising candidates with potential antimicrobial activity. This research strengthened my expertise in bioinformatics, predictive modeling, and computational drug discovery, while developing skills in Python, data analysis libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and handling complex biomedical data.</p>
    <h3>🧪Identification of drug targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Biomedical Literature</h3>
    <p>Bioinformatic's project: Identification of drug targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from biomedical literature. Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze relevant information from scientific texts, enabling the identification of potential drug targets. Developed skills in text mining, data processing, and Python-based ML tools, contributing to computational approaches in drug discovery.</p>
